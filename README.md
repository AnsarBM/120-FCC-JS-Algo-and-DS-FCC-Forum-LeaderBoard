# 120-FCC-JS-Algo-and-DS-FCC-Forum-LeaderBoard

In this project, we learn "Asynchronous Programming" by creating FCC Forum LeaderBoard.
The project covers the "Fetch API", "promises", "Async/Await", and the "try..catch" statement.

Keep in mind that JavaScript is an Asynchronous Programming Language. So this project helps you in understanding and gaining efficiency in asynchronous concepts.
